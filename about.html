		<h2>ABOUT THE WORK</h2>
			<p>I have always felt that science and art speak the same language. Perhaps being the daughter of an artist and a doctor helped me to avoid the artificial separation of two confluent worlds. It is with this premise that I approach my work. 
			</p>
			<p>
			My work is photomicroscopy: photography using the microscope as the lens. I use both a light microscope and a scanning electron microscope. I begin by obtaining and preparing specimens; a lengthy process. Each picture is shot with a photographic device attached to the microscope. The transparency is then scanned into my computer where I digitally explore and enhance the image. All prints are made on fine art paper using a giclee printer. 
			</p>
			<p>
			Why do I do this kind of work? I can't fully explain. However, there are some things I know for sure:
				<ul>
					<li>I love how the boundaries of art and science merge.</li>
					<li>Seeing things on a microscopic level is endlessly fascinating to me.</li>
					<li>I hope to convey some of the beauty, intricacy and mystery of what I see and imagine.</li>
				</ul>
